Description: 
    Provides differentially private copula-based correlation estimation using two complementary approaches: 
    a Bayesian noise-aware method implemented via Stan and a maximum-likelihood noise-naive method. The 
    package also includes range-preserving post-processing mechanisms, helper utilities for copula modeling, 
    and tools for integrating privacy noise into correlation estimation workflows.
