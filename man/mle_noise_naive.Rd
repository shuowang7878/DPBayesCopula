\usage{
mle_noise_naive(data, epsilon, method = c("RTG", "TGM", "BTGM"), seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric data.frame or matrix. No missing values allowed.}

\item{epsilon}{Total privacy budget. The per-pair budget is
\code{epsilon / choose(p, 2)}.}

\item{method}{One of \code{"RTG"}, \code{"TGM"}, or \code{"BTGM"}.}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed (affects DP noise and tie-breaking).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{estimation}{Estimated \eqn{p \times p} correlation matrix
(positive-semidefinite).}
\item{dp}{List containing \code{epsilon}, \code{epsilon_per_pair},
and \code{sensitivity}.}
}
}
\description{
Implements the MLE noise-naive (MLE-NN) estimator for a Gaussian copula
correlation matrix under differential privacy. Each variable is binarized
into "low" and "high" groups using the sample median with random
tie-breaking so that exactly \code{ceil(n/2)} observations fall into the
"high" group. Pairwise high–high counts are then perturbed using one of three
range-preserving mechanisms (RTG, TGM, BTGM). The resulting noisy statistics
are treated as if they were true counts, yielding a noise-naive likelihood
estimator of the copula correlations.
