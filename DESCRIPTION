Description:
    Provides differentially private copula-based correlation estimation using two complementary approaches:
    a Bayesian noise-aware method implemented via Stan and a maximum-likelihood noise-naive method. The
    package also includes truncated geometric post-processing mechanisms, helper utilities for copula modeling,
    and tools for integrating privacy noise into correlation estimation workflows.
