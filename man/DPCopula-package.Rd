\title{DPCopula: Differentially Private Copula Correlation Estimation}
\description{
The \code{DPCopula} package provides differentially private estimators for
Gaussian copula correlation matrices. It implements:
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item A Bayesian noise-aware (Bayes-NA) estimator that explicitly accounts
for differential privacy noise through a Bayesian model fitted in Stan.
\item A maximum-likelihood noise-naive (MLE-NN) estimator that treats
range-preserving noisy counts as if they were true statistics.
}

Both methods rely on pairwise high--high counts based on median
binarization with lexicographic tie-breaking, together with
differentially private geometric or range-preserving mechanisms.
