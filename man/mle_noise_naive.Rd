\title{MLE noise-naive differentially private Gaussian copula}
\usage{
mle_noise_naive(data, epsilon, method = c("RTG", "TGM", "BTGM"), seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric data.frame or matrix. No missing values allowed.}

\item{epsilon}{Total privacy budget. The per-pair budget is
\code{epsilon / choose(p, 2)}.}

\item{method}{One of \code{"RTG"}, \code{"TGM"}, or \code{"BTGM"}.}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed (affects DP noise and tie-breaking).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{estimation}: Estimated p x p correlation matrix (positive-semidefinite).
\item \code{dp}: List containing epsilon, epsilon_per_pair, and sensitivity.
}
}
\description{
Implements the MLE noise-naive (MLE-NN) estimator for a Gaussian copula
correlation matrix under differential privacy. Each variable is binarized
into "low" and "high" groups using the sample median with random
tie-breaking so that exactly \code{ceil(n/2)} observations fall into the
"high" group. Pairwise high–high counts are then perturbed using one of three
truncated geometric mechanisms (RTG, TGM, BTGM). The resulting noisy statistics
are treated as if they were true counts, yielding a noise-naive likelihood
estimator of the copula correlations.
